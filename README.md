# JavaScript and TypeScript `.gitignore` Template

A `.gitignore` template for JavaScript and TypeScript projects.

## Getting the Template

Clone latest: `git clone https://github.com/moonjellydigital/js-gitignore.git`

Clone a particular version: `git clone -b <tag_name> https://github.com/moonjellydigital/js-gitignore.git`

Download latest `JS.gitignore` file: `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonjellydigital/js-gitignore/main/JS.gitignore`

## Usage

Once you've obtained the template by your preferred method, edit the
`JS.gitignore` file to meet your project's requirements. Rename the file to
`.gitignore` and add it to your project.

## Gatsby Projects

If you're using Gatsby, be sure to uncomment the `public` build directory 
entry on line 120. It's commented out by default to prevent conflicts with
Next.js.

## Versioning

This project uses Ubuntu-style calendar versioning with a short year and
zero-padded month. A new tag will be available each time the `JS.gitignore`
template file is updated. This makes dependency pinning simple and convenient 
for project scaffolding scripts and other automation.
